## Technical Communication in My Life
Perhaps the place I use technical communication the most in my life is at my job. I'm a web developer for a smaller marketing agency, which means I often need to communicate web development principles in easy to understand language. Furthermore, I often need to include information in my code to make it easier to maintain for other developers, challenging me to explain my code in brief and easy to understand language.

As for my future career, I suspect my use of technical communication will develop further as I take on more challenging projects. I intend to become a machine learning specialist, which will mean that I'll likely have to spend a good amount of time explaining to people how they might train the algorithm, and how to use the software I've created.
## About Me
I'm a tech nerd who loves reading, video games, and rock climbing. My major is in computer sciece, and my favorite places are a comfortable office or a mountaintop.
